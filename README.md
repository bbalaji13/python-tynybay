Certainly! I've updated the README file to include the installation of the required dependencies using the `pip` command. Here's the modified version of the README file:

# PDF to JSONL Converter

Convert PDF files to JSONL (JSON Lines) format using this Python script.

## Description

This Python script converts PDF files into JSONL format. It extracts text from PDF pages and structures the data as JSON objects in a JSONL file.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- [PyMuPDF library](https://pymupdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) (`pip install PyMuPDF`)
- [jsonlines library](https://jsonlines.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#installation) (`pip install jsonlines`)

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pdf-to-jsonl-converter.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the repository directory:

   ```sh
   cd pdf-to-jsonl-converter
   ```

3. Place the PDF file you want to convert in the same directory.

4. Open a terminal or command prompt.

5. Install the required dependencies:

   ```sh
   pip install PyMuPDF jsonlines
   ```

6. Run the script:

   ```sh
   python pdf_to_jsonl_converter.py
   ```

   The converted JSONL file will be created in the same directory.

## Customization

- Modify the `pdf_to_jsonl_converter.py` script to perform additional processing on the extracted text or structure the JSON objects differently according to your requirements.

In this version, I've provided direct links to the installation instructions for both the PyMuPDF and jsonlines libraries. Additionally, the installation of the dependencies is now part of the usage instructions.
